# Qiskit Hackathon Europe

## Project
Quantum algorithm that will be able to solve a maze and try to get better results than a classic AI.

## The Pitch
Artificial intelligence is recognized by many as the future of computing but there still too few people that perceive the power of quantum computing. Therefore, we would like to make this technology better known by demonstrating its potential in a playful manner.

## The Proposal Overview
Our goal is to develop an algorithm capable of solving a labyrinth in the least number of moves. In parallel we will train an AI. And we will compare the two results. We hope to show that execution on a quantum computer will exceed the AI in execution time and number of moves.

## Project Breakdown
- Develop a quantum solver
> We are going to develop a quantum labyrinth solver which will be able to find the solution to a labyrinth in the least number of moves.

- AI training
> We are going to train an AI to solve similar mazes. And this so that it tries to be able to surpass the quantum algorithm in number of moves.

- The Fight
> Comparison of results obtained by quantum resolution and classical AI
